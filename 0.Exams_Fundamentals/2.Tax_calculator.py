# ------------------------------------- Problem to resolve ------------------------------
#
# You will be given a string representing vehicles that will be taxed. Each vehicle is separated
# by ">>", where the first element is a string representing the car type, second - integer for
# the years the tax should be paid and the third - integer with kilometers traveled.
# There are 3 valid types of vehicles:
#       * family - the initial tax for a family car is 50 euros.
#       * heavyDuty - the initial tax for heavy-duty is 80 euros.
#       * sports - the initial tax for sports car is 100 euros.
# If the car is not valid print: "Invalid car type." and continue to the next vehicle.
# When calculating tax keep in mind the following rules:
#       - for family car, the tax declines by 5 euros for every year in use. Also the tax
#       increases by 12 euros for every 3000km traveled.
#       - for heavy-duty, the tax declines by 8 euros for every year in use. Also the tax
#       increases by 14 euros for every 9000km traveled.
#       - for sports car, the tax declines by 9 euros for every year in use. Also the tax
#       increases by 18 euros for every 3000km traveled.
# Input
# The possible commands are:
# "vehicle1>>vehicle2>>vehicle3…"
# "family"
# "heavyDuty"
# "sports"
# Output
# The possible outputs are:
# "Invalid car type."
# "A {car type} car will pay {total tax to pay} euros in taxes."
# "The NRA will collect {total tax collected} euros in taxes."
