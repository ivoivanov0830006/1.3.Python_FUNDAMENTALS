# ------------------------------------- Another Solution -----------------------------
#
# import re
# pattern = r"www\.[a-zA-Z0-9-\.]+\.[a-z]+"
# while True:
#     text = input()
#     if not text:
#         break
#     valid_url = re.findall(pattern, text)
#     if valid_url:
#         print("\n".join(valid_url))


# ------------------------------------- Problem to resolve ------------------------------
#
# Write a program that extracts links from a given text. The text will come in the form of strings, each
# representing a sentence. You need to extract only the valid links from it. Example:
#                       "www.internet.com"
#       Sub-Domain			 Domain name		        Domain extension
#   * The Sub-Domain must always be "www".
#   * The Domain name can consist of English alphabet letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and dashes ("–")
#   * The Domain extension consists of one or more domain blocks, a domain block consists of a dot followed
#   by one or more lowercase English alphabet letters,
#   * Domain extension must have at least one domain block in order to be valid.
#   * The Sub-Domain and Domain name must be separated by a single dot.
# Any link that does NOT follow the specified above rules should be treated as invalid.
#   Example incorrect links:
#       "ww.justASite.bg"
#       "lel.awesome.com"
#       "www.weird_site.hit.bg"
#       "www.no-symb#^ols-allow%ed.com"
#       "www.mark.12"
#       "www.web-site."
#       "www.example-site._*^#"
#   Example of correct links:
#       "Some textwww.softuni.bg"
#       "Just a link in a www.sea-of-text.bg-swimming around"
#       "Instruments www.Instruments.rom.com.trombone2000 Instrument here"
#       "All your ice cream flavors-www.scream.for.ice.cream(We  also have squirrels)"
# The output is all valid links you have found, printed – each on a new line.
