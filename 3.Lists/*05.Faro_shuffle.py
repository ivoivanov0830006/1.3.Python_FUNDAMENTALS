# --------------------------- Problem to resolve -----------------------------
#
# A faro shuffle is a method for shuffling a deck of cards, in which the deck is split exactly in half.
# Then the cards in the two halves are perfectly interleaved, such that the original bottom card is
# still on the bottom and the original top card is still on top.
# For example, faro shuffling the list ['ace', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six'] once, gives
# ['ace', 'four', 'two', 'five', 'three', 'six']
# Write a program that receives a single string (cards separated by space) and on the second line
# receives a count of faro shuffles that should be made. Print the state of the deck after the shuffle.
# Note: The length of the deck of cards will always be an even number.
